This workshop is designed to connect early career researchers (<7 years since your PhD defense) such as PhD, Postdocs, and Researchers in Norway who are interested in the intersection of glaciology and machine learning. This workshop is targeted towards people who already have decent programming skills in their preferred language and want to increase their skills in machine learning related to glaciology. It is highly preferred that you have some experiences using either python, C/C++, or Julia for research you currently are working on. There are 10 spots available in the workshop.

If you are selected to attend this workshop all costs associated with the workshop will be covered through reimbursement through University of Oslo.

In this workshop you will learn how to:

1. Digest large glacier data sets via the python data analysis library pandas from sources such as the RGI database or the output of Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM).

2. Perform exploratory data analysis with python visualizing data by creating maps, scatter plots, and histograms.

3. Students will be able to compare/contrast the difference between classification and regression models.

4. Students will be able to identify ML project goals with regards to explanation or prediction.

5. Students will create and analyse ML models using the python library scikit-learn. This includes simple train-test splits, cross validation, and specific validation techniques related to time series data.

6. Students will be able to apply ML models using python ML libraries such as Xgboost and pytorch (Artificial Neural Networks).

The workshop will be organized around student projects that will be conducted during the week with the help of the instructors. We encourage that the projects idea are enhanced by the participants and that can contribute to their research. To support these, the instructors will provide lectures covering machine learning techniques and glaciology topic at the beginning of the week. We are as well planning on a full day excursion on the neighbouring glacier, Midtdalsbreen. The participants projects and preliminary results will be presented at the end of the week.

This workshop will count for 2 ECTS credits for PhD students attending.The workshop will be generally structured as following:

a) A full day excursion on a glacier

b) 6 lectures (main challenges in glaciology, introduction to machine learning concepts, glacier evolution and parametrization of a glacier evolution with neural networks, remote sensing of debris covered glaciers and object based image analysis, deep learning for remote sensing glacier extents, glacier instabilities and analysis of model output)

c) Daily time to work on your project

d) A mini-conference to present the results of the projects
