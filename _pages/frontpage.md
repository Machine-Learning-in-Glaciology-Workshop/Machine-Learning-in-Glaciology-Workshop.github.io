The 3rd Machine Learning in Glaciology Workshop will be held from 6 - 12 September 2024 at the [Finse Alpine Research Center](https://www.finse.uio.no/) between Oslo and Bergen in Norway. The station is located near the Hardangerjøkulen Ice Cap with its outlet gaciers in sight. The workshop is designed to connect researchers at all career stages who are interested in the intersection of glaciology and machine learning. It is targeted towards scientists who already have basic to medium programming and machine learning skills and want to increase their skills in machine learning related to glaciology. This workshop is primarily project based. You can learn more about the projects on the [projects page](projects.md). All the lecture materials are gathered in a Jupyter Book, which is being updated iteratively with participant's feedback. Participants may also design their own project based on own ideas and data in collaboration with the instructors.

# Application

If you wish to participate in the workshop, please apply [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBsO1FY7G9QWe3NMz7jMh979RxElithP54EkH52jhWBPUNpg/viewform) by 12 April 2024, 11:59pm (in whatever time zone you are in). The number of participants is limited to 25 and applicants will be informed about admission via email by early May. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at mlglaciology.workshop@gmail.com.

# Agenda

The workshop will include:

- Lectures on machine learning applied to glacier modelling and glacier mapping from satellite data, JupyterHub + Git and related topics (ca. 1 day)
- Hands-on project work: Participants will work on of [two pre-defined](https://machine-learning-in-glaciology-workshop.github.io/projects) projects "Modelling glacier mass balance with machine learning“, or “Glacier mapping from satellite data using Deep Learning and Random Forests”. They may also design their own project based on own ideas and data in collaboration with the instructors and other participants in a “hackathon-type” fashion. 
- 2-hour mini-conference where all participants present the results from their projects.
- Free afternoon for outdoor activities (hiking, running).
