This workshop is designed to connect early career researchers (<7 years since your PhD defense) such as PhD, Postdocs, and Researchers in Norway who are interested in the intersection of glaciology and machine learning. This workshop is targeted towards people who already have decent programming skills in their preferred language and want to increase their skills in machine learning related to glaciology. It is highly preferred that you have some experiences using either python, C/C++, or Julia for research you currently are working on. There are 10 spots available in the workshop.

This workshop is primarily project based. You can learn more about the projects [on the projects page](projects.md).
