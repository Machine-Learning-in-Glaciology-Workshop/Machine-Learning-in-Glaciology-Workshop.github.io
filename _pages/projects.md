The primary goal of this workshop is to work on a project with one of the instructors for a week. Below you will find projects you can work on.

# Project 1 - Jordi Bolibar

# Project 2 - Deriving large-scale glacier changes in Nepal - Benjamin Robson

The fundamentals in glacier mapping using CNN + OBIA from the practical can be upscaled with a few different possible directions. One possibility is modifying the approach to work with a larger area (for example regional mapping across a large part of Nepal) and then compare the mapping with the current GLIMS outlines. Another idea could be applying the routine to historical satellite data such as declassified Corona spy imagery to derive multi-temporal glacier inventories.

# Project 3 - Deep Learning for glacier mapping from optical and SAR satellite imagery - Konstantin Maslov and Thomas Schellenberger

The students will have the possibility to learn how to map debris-covered glaciers in Pakistan from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 data and a digital elevation model using fully convolutional neural networks. They can also test the scalability and transferability of several networks to different regions and years or extend the exercise to map glacier surface types.
