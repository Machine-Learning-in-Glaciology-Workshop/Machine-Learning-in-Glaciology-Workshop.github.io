The primary goal of this workshop is to work on a project with one of the instructors for a week. Below you will find projects you can work on.

### Project 1 [Modelling] - [Modelling glacier mass balance with machine learning](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-in-Glaciology-Workshop/Project_MB_Regression) - *Jordi Bolibar and Facu Sapienza*

The goal of this project will be to learn and apply different types of machine learning and statistical regression methods (e.g. Lasso/Ridge, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, neural networks...) to simulate glacier mass balance (MB) for all glaciers in Scandinavia. We will use the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) to retrieve glaciological and geodetic MB observations, and we will train multiple ML models using topographical and climate data. By using a common set of cross-validation folds, we will compare the different ML methods in order to understand their strenghts and weaknesses. Moreover, we will learn how to add soft physical constraints to the models. If needed, the project could be extended to also include ice flow dynamics, and eventually physics informed learning. 

### Project 2 [Remote sensing] - Deep Learning for glacier mapping - *Benjamin Robson, Konstantin Maslov and Thomas Schellenberger*

The fundamentals in glacier mapping using CNN + OBIA from the practical can be upscaled with a few different possible directions. One possibility is modifying the approach to work with a larger area (for example regional mapping across a large part of Nepal) and then compare the mapping with the current GLIMS outlines. Another idea could be applying the routine to historical satellite data such as declassified Corona spy imagery to derive multi-temporal glacier inventories.

The students will have the possibility to learn how to map debris-covered glaciers in Pakistan and the Alps from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 data and a digital elevation model using fully convolutional neural networks. They can also test the scalability and transferability of several networks to different regions and years or extend the exercise to map glacier surface types.
