# Registration
If you wish to participate in the workshop, please fill out the following form latest by 9 January 2023. Accepted participants will be informed per email latest by the end of January. We will announce here when the selection has been made.

# Computing environment

The workshop infrastructure for applications using GPUs (i.e. remote sensing) will be provided by CloudFerro (https://cloudferro.com/en/) and applicants will have access to the EO data archive on CREODIAS (https://creodias.eu/). For CPU-based applications (i.e. modelling) a JupyterHub will be available with all data and dependencies already pre-installed.

# Who can participate?

Anyone interested in using machine learning techniques in glaciology. Some experience in  programming (ideally in Python or Julia) is required. Since the focus is on "hands-on" project work we also require some basic knowledge in machine learning prior to the workshop. 

# Costs

Costs for registration, housing (5 nights) and all meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks/coffee) at Finse Research Station fee will be approx. 7000 NOK (Norwegian Krones = approx. 700 Euros/US$). The fee may be lower (esp. for Norwegian-based participants) pending our success in receiving external funding. Travel grants are not available for foreign participants. Accepted participants must pay a non-refundable registration fee of 400 NOK latest by 15 February 2023. The rest of the fee must be paid latest by 3 April 2023. Refund policy for cancellations: 100% of total fee until 3 April 24:00 (CET), 50% until 6 April 24:00, 10% after 7 April 00:00).

# Location
The workshop will be held at the Finse Alpine Research Center run by Oslo and Bergen University. The station is located near the >70 km2 Hardangerjøkulen Ice Cap with one of the outlet glaciers 1-2 km away and well visible from the Research Station. Finse is a tiny mountain village with only a few houses located at the Oslo - Bergen railroad at 1,222 meters (4,009 ft) above sea level, about 250 m above the treeline. There is no road to Finse. Facilities are very limited, e.g., there is no grocery store, pharmacy or bank. In April there will be lots of snow and temperatures can be well below freezing with high winds.
 
# Transportation
Finse is only accessible by train, from either Oslo central station (Oslo S) (ca. 4.5 hrs; ca. 6 trains per day between ca. 6:00 and 23:00; ca. 600 NOK one way) or Bergen (ca. 2.5 hrs). Tickets can be bought at www.vy.no. The earlier you book the cheaper the tickets. From Finse train station it is a 15-20 minute walk (ca. 1.5 km) along a small dirt road/hiking path (snow-covered in April) to the research station. A snowmobile shuttle may be arranged for transporting luggage between the train station and the research centre.
 
## Airport Gardermoen to Oslo
From the airport you need to take a train to the central train station (Oslo S) where the train to Finse departs. Turn to the right when getting out of customs and walk about 50 m where you can buy the train ticket to Oslo at a counter or ticket machine. There are two independent companies selling tickets side by side:
- Flytoget (flight train), fastest, ca. 20 minutes, 220 NOK
- "Normal" train by company ´vy´, ca. 30 minutes, 115 NOK. This train may actually get you faster to Oslo depending when you get there since it goes more often. Trains R10, R11 and L12 go to Oslo.
 
You can also buy the tickets online (www.vy.no or https://flytoget.no/en/). From the ticket counter/machines it is a 2 minute walk to the platform (down the escalator).
 
## Airport Flesland to Bergen
Line 1 of the city light rail (“bybanen” in Norwegian) links the airport with central Bergen and the train station. Tickets cost 39 NOK and takes about 40 minutes. Tickets can be bought on the skyss app or on the machines at the station. There is also an airport bus (flybussen.no) which costs 149 NOK one way and takes about 25 minutes. 

# Arrival / departure dates
The workshop starts at Finse on 16 April 2023 and ends on Friday 21 April at 1 pm. All participants are required to attend the entire course, i.e. it is not possible to come later or leave earlier.

# Accommodation / meals
All participants will be housed at the Finse Research Station (run by the Universities of Oslo and Bergen) which has a number of 2-4 bed rooms which participants will share. We will be the only group at the station at that time. A cook at the station will provide all meals for the workshop (dietary restrictions can be accommodated). The station has a small lecture hall and internet (4G eduroam and University of Oslo guest login).
 
# Practical information

Please bring:

- Laptop for project work (the wifi connection goes through eduroam)
- If needed, travel adapter for power outlet
- Name tag (e.g. from a previous conference)
- Indoor shoes/slippers (there are no shoes allowed inside and the floor is quite cold)
- Head lamp/ flashlight (there are no streetlights)
- Best to use a backpack for all your belongings. You need to walk approx. 1.5 km from the train station to the Research Station over a snow-covered dirt road. Roller suitcases do not work
- Consider bringing cross-country skis or snow shoes for the free afternoon (or to get to the Research Station from the train station)
- Sun glasses
- Warm clothes, hat, gloves, scarf etc (there will be lots of snow)
- Boots suitable to walk in deep snow
- Make sure you have appropriate health insurance
- Any personal medication
- Special foods (no grocery store in Finse).

# COVID
Continued covid outbreaks at conferences and workshops have shown how disruptive it can be, with many people being sick and stuck abroad. Given the remote location of Finse combined with that we will be living close together, - depending on the situation then - we may require participants to adhere to certain COVID mitigation measures (regardless of official government rules). These may include wearing masks and/or testing before and during the workshop and will be mandatory for all participants.
