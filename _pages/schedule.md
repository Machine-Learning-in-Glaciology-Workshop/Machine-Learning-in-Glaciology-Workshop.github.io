## Outdoor activity
2023 edition - This year's edition will be by early spring, with still a lot of snow in Finse.
We reserve one afternoon for self-organized outdoor activities, so please bring:

Head lamp/ flashlight (there are no streetlights)
Best to use a backpack for all your belongings.
Consider bringing cross-country skis or snow shoes.
Sun glasses.
Warm clothes, hat, gloves, scarf etc (there will be lots of snow).
Boots suitable to walk in deep snow.
Make sure you have appropriate health insurance.
Any personal medication.
Special foods (no grocery store in Finse).

## Lectures

You will find all the lecture notes in this [Jupyter Book](https://machine-learning-in-glaciology-workshop.github.io/Lecture-materials/README.html). If you wish to suggest any changes (any typo corrections or improvements are welcome!), you can do so in the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-in-Glaciology-Workshop/Instructor-notes). 

# [ Modelling ] Jordi Bolibar - [Physics-based machine learning for glacier modelling](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-in-Glaciology-Workshop/ML_for_Glacier_Modelling)

[The presentation](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-in-Glaciology-Workshop/Mass_Balance_ML_modelling/raw/main/Presentation_PhysicsBased_ML_Glaciology.pptx)
introduces students to the general concepts of a machine learning pipeline. How to properly design a dataset, how to correctly
train models and how validate, test and understand the capabilities and limitation of the model(s). 

The following contents are covered:

- **Modelling the glacier system**
  - Glacier evolution models
  - Local vs Global glacier modelling
  
- **Physics-based machine learning**
  - Machine learning pipelines
  - Regression for physical processes
    - Respecting physics
      - Feature selection
      - Data driven machine learning
      - Physical losses or Physics-Informed Neural Networks
      - Neural/Universal Differential Equations
    - Trustworthy models
      - Testing and validation
      - Physical interpretation
    - Being mindful about model limitations

# [ Remote sensing ] Benjamin Robson, Konstantin Maslov and Thomas Schellenberger - Glacier mapping from optical and SAR satellite imagery using Deep Learning and Random Forests.

A review of the different methods that glaciers are mapped using satellite data, starting with the simple methods such as spectral band ratios that were used to create the Norwegian glacier inventories, to the data fusion and geomorphological based methods for identifying debris-covered glaciers. The last part of the lecture will focus on both OBIA (object based image analysis), and the use of convolutional neural networks. There will also be a summary of relevant datasets which will lead into the practical.

The three presentations will cover:
- **Remote Sensing in Glaciology Remote Sensing in Glaciology â€“ the traditional basics** (T. Schellenberger)
  - Intro Optical and SAR remote sensing
  - Glacier extend mapping
  - Glacier zone mapping
  - Challenges
- [**Random Forest and Deep learning image classification for Glacier Mapping**](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-in-Glaciology-Workshop/Glacier-Mapping-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20for%20Glacier%20Mapping.pdf) (K. Maslov)
  - Intro to ML image classification
  - Random Forest
  - Deep learning
- **Cryospheric Mapping with Remote Sensing - an overview of the problems, data and methods with a focus on OBIA and debris-covered glaciers** (B. Robson)
  - Object based image analysis
  - Mapping debris-covered glaciers
- **Project description**


# [ Software ] Facundo Sapienza and Ellianna Abrahams - Introduction to Jupyter Hub and Git
An introduction on how to use the JupyterHub, Jupyter notebooks and using Git for collaborative projects.

# [ Statistics ] Ellianna Abrahams - CryoStats
The rest of the mornings will start with short friendly lectures on Statistics and machine learning by Ellie. The idea is to learn in an intuitive way important notions when using statistical and machine learning methods in glaciology and geosciences in general.

# [ Glaciology ] Everyone - Examples of ML in Glaciology
The goal of this section will be for instructors to give short 15-minute presentations showing applications of ML in glaciology from their research. Students will aslo be able to give short presentations of their work (around 5 minutes). If they wish to present something longer, please contact us in advance.
