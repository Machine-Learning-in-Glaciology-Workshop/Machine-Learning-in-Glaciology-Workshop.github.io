# Tuesday Lectures

Tuesday will begin with lectures on the following topics:

## Jordi Bolibar - topic

## Benjamin Robson - Glacier mapping from satellite data: a review of techniques and methodologies
A review of the different methods that glaciers are mapped using satellite data, starting with the simple methods such as spectral band ratios that were used to create the Norwegian glacier inventories, to the data fusion and geomorphological based methods for identifying debris-covered glaciers. The last part of the lecture will focus on both OBIA (object based image analysis), and the use of convolutional neural networks. There will also be a summary of relevant datasets which will lead into the practical.

## Thomas Schellenberger - topic

# Tuesday Activities

Tuesday will also have introductory activities for each project along with an introduction to using the JupyterHub provided by
