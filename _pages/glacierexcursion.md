*The outlet glacier Middalen, Hardangerjøkulen*

We will have a glacier excursion, weather permitting, so that we can explore the great natural environment that we will then return to explore through our computers.

Please come prepared and bring:

●  Waterproof hiking shoes/boots

●  Waterproof jacket and pants, warm clothes (it may be snowing)

●  Gaiters - there may be snow

●  Winter hat, scarf, mittens/gloves

●  Sun protection: sunglasses, sunscreen

●  Daypack for glacier hike

●  Indoor shoes/slippers for inside

We also recommend people purchase microspikes in lieu of wearing full crampons: https://kahtoola.com/traction/microspikes-footwear-traction/
