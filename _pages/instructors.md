# John M. Aiken

John is a postdoctoral researcher/data scientist working in the UiO Njord Centre for Studies of the Physics of the Earth. His research background has focused on integrating ML within the problem spaces of seismology/geophysics, glaciology, and social science. These works include predicting fracture development in laboratory experiments, investigating instabilities on glaciers, image analysis of rock core samples to assess CO2 injection sites, detecting cracking events due to fluid motion, and predicting university student decision making. John brings a strong focus on integrating ML into physical based projects.

Jordi is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research in Utrecht University (Netherlands). Jordi’s research focuses on applying ML to model, understand and predict climate-glacier interactions at large geographical scales. He's currently working on [ODINN](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl), a project and modelling framework to investigate new ways to learn laws governing climate-glacier interactions using machine learning and differential equations.  He has also developed the ALpine Parameterized Glacier Model (ALPGM), a deep learning-based fully parameterized glacier model to simulate the evolution of alpine glaciers for past and future periods.

Regine is a hydrologist and glaciologist using modeling and field data to assess glacier mass changes and to predict the response of glaciers to future climate change and assess the implications on sea-level and hydrology.

# Benjamin Aubrey Robson

Ben’s research is focused on using remote sensing datasets to understand glacial and periglacial landscapes and how they have been changing. I use a variety of remote sensing techniques including object-based image analysis (OBIA), photogrammetry and DEM comparison, structure from motion (SfM), LiDAR and time-series analysis. I'm active in research in the Nepali Himalayas, European Alps, Norwegian mainland, and the Tien Shan mountains.

# Thomas Schellenberger

Thomas investigates the dynamics of glaciers using remote observation data using satellites such as  TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2. He uses the radar satellite data to extract glacier velocities of all fast flowing glaciers and changes in their extend. From these data it is possible to estimate the iceberg production of the glaciers which terminate in the sea. Thomas currently is working on using machine learning to identify glacier extents using remote sensing data.
