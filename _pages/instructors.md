Ellie is a PhD Candidate at UC Berkeley working on image-based machine learning using Antarctic remote sensing datasets. Ellie’s PhD focuses on the detection of polynyas and the characterization of their time-domain properties as a population. Ellie currently works on teaching neural networks flexibility in the face of uncertain data, and has experience with Bayesian regression, deep learning, and causal inference.

Jordi is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research in Utrecht University (Netherlands). Jordi’s research focuses on applying ML to model, understand and predict climate-glacier interactions at large geographical scales. He's currently working on <a href="https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl">ODINN</a>, a project and modelling framework to investigate new ways to learn laws governing climate-glacier interactions using machine learning and differential equations.  He has also developed the ALpine Parameterized Glacier Model (ALPGM), a deep learning-based fully parameterized glacier model to simulate the evolution of alpine glaciers for past and future periods.

Konstantin is a PhD student at the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science from Tomsk Polytechnic University, Russia. His main research interests are methods of machine learning applied to Earth Observation data. Most of the time he deals with convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation but he is also keen on other approaches for image analysis and problems at the intersection of Remote Sensing and Data Science.  He is currently working glacier mapping and glacier mass balance estimation using deep learning.

Fernando Pérez is an assistant professor in Statistics at UC Berkeley and a Faculty Scientist in the Department of Data Science and Technology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. After completing a PhD in particle physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, his postdoctoral research in applied mathematics centered on the development of fast algorithms for the solution of partial differential equations in multiple dimensions.  Today, his research focuses on creating tools for modern computational research and data science across domain disciplines, with an emphasis on high-level languages, interactive and literate computing, and reproducible research.  He created IPython while a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded its successor, Project Jupyter. The Jupyter team collaborates openly to create the next generation of tools for human-driven computational exploration, data analysis, scientific insight and education.

Ben’s research is focused on using remote sensing datasets to understand glacial and periglacial landscapes and how they have been changing. I use a variety of remote sensing techniques including object-based image analysis (OBIA), photogrammetry and DEM comparison, structure from motion (SfM), LiDAR and time-series analysis. I'm active in research in the Nepali Himalayas, European Alps, Norwegian mainland, and the Tien Shan mountains.

Facundo (Facu) Sapienza is a PhD candidate in the Statistics department at the University of California, Berkeley. Facu’s work includes the use of neural differential equations in the modeling of ice flow, where sub-parts of the governing differential equation can be parametrized by physical-informed proxies; feature detection algorithms in ice sheets using remote sensing data; and machine learning methods applied to paleomagnetism and planetary sciences. He is also interested in the development and communication of open-source tools for scientific computing.

Thomas investigates the dynamics of glaciers using remote observation data using SAR and optical satellite data. He uses the SAR satellite data to extract glacier velocities of all fast flowing glaciers and changes in their extend. From these data it is possible to estimate the iceberg production of the glaciers which terminate in the sea. Thomas currently is working on using machine learning to identify glacier extents and estimate glacier mass balance using remote sensing data.
