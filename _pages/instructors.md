Ellie is a PhD Candidate at UC Berkeley working on image-based machine learning using Antarctic remote sensing datasets. Ellie’s PhD focuses on the detection of polynyas and the characterization of their time-domain properties as a population. Ellie currently works on teaching neural networks flexibility in the face of uncertain data, and has experience with Bayesian regression, deep learning, and causal inference.

John is a postdoctoral researcher/data scientist working in the UiO Njord Centre for Studies of the Physics of the Earth. His research background has focused on integrating ML within the problem spaces of seismology/geophysics, glaciology, and social science. These works include predicting fracture development in laboratory experiments, investigating instabilities on glaciers, image analysis of rock core samples to assess CO2 injection sites, detecting cracking events due to fluid motion, and predicting university student decision making. John brings a strong focus on integrating ML into physical based projects.

Jordi is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research in Utrecht University (Netherlands). Jordi’s research focuses on applying ML to model, understand and predict climate-glacier interactions at large geographical scales. He's currently working on <a href="https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl">ODINN</a>, a project and modelling framework to investigate new ways to learn laws governing climate-glacier interactions using machine learning and differential equations.  He has also developed the ALpine Parameterized Glacier Model (ALPGM), a deep learning-based fully parameterized glacier model to simulate the evolution of alpine glaciers for past and future periods.

Hi! My name is Konstantin. I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science from Tomsk Polytechnic University. I am working on deep learning for glacier mapping and glacier mass balance estimation. My main research interests are methods of machine learning applied to Earth Observation data. Most of the time I deal with convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation but I am also keen on other approaches for image analysis and problems at the intersection of Remote Sensing and Data Science.

Ben’s research is focused on using remote sensing datasets to understand glacial and periglacial landscapes and how they have been changing. I use a variety of remote sensing techniques including object-based image analysis (OBIA), photogrammetry and DEM comparison, structure from motion (SfM), LiDAR and time-series analysis. I'm active in research in the Nepali Himalayas, European Alps, Norwegian mainland, and the Tien Shan mountains.

Facundo (Facu) Sapienza is a PhD candidate in the Statistics department at the University of California, Berkeley. Facu’s work includes the use of neural differential equations in the modeling of ice flow, where sub-parts of the governing differential equation can be parametrized by physical-informed proxies; feature detection algorithms in ice sheets using remote sensing data; and machine learning methods applied to paleomagnetism and planetary sciences. He is also interested in the development and communication of open-source tools for scientific computing.

Thomas investigates the dynamics of glaciers using remote observation data using satellites such as  TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2. He uses the radar satellite data to extract glacier velocities of all fast flowing glaciers and changes in their extend. From these data it is possible to estimate the iceberg production of the glaciers which terminate in the sea. Thomas currently is working on using machine learning to identify glacier extents using remote sensing data.
